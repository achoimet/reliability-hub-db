# Introduction

This action leverages GCP / Google Cloud API to manipulate the state of GCP virtual machines. More specifically, it can reset, delete, stop or suspend them.

# Use Cases

- Verify auto-scaling of a Kubernetes node group.
- Understand how pods are shifted across different nodes within a Kubernetes cluster.
- Verify that system services come up on system start.
- Check that your monitoring solution informs you about this occurrence.

# Rollback

Note that this attack does not support any rollback. The attack only transmits the API call, e.g., Stop or Delete virtual machine.

# Parameters

| Parameter | Description                                                                      | Default |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Action    | How the virtual machine state should be changed. Reset, delete, stop or suspend. |         |

# Notes
Virtual Machines of Kubernetes Engine can be attacked as well, when the cluster is created as standard cluster (not autopilot).
