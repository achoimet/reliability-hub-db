# Introduction

[JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/) is a Java Application designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance. You can integrate the execution of JMeter load tests directly into your experiments.

# Details

To use JMeter you need to upload your JMeter-Test-Script. Test-Scripts can be created by the JMeter-GUI.

Uploading can be done simply by adding a step of type "JMeter" and use the provided File-Upload.

Within the JMeter load test you have access to your provided parameters as environment variables. You can use them in the script via e.g. `${__P(TARGET_HOST)}`.

# Report

After execution, JMeter results and logs are transferred to the platform.

# Step result / Assertions

You can use [jmeter assertions](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#assertions) to control the loadtest-step-result in the platform.

We will scan the report for non empty `<failureMessage>`-Tags and let the step fail if there are any.
