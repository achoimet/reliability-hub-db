# Introduction

Sets an annotation on the deployment which then causes Kubernetes to update all pods within the deployment (essentially `kubectl rollout restart -n {{NAMESPACE}} {{DEPLOYMENT}}`). Does not wait for the rollout to complete. Stopping this attack will not stop the rollout.

# Parameters
