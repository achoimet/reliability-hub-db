# Introduction

The node count check can be used within a **Kubernetes** cluster to check the status of nodes.

# Details

It counts the number of all nodes and performs the check defined by the given check type.

You can limit the node count to a specific cluster

# Parameters

## Node Count

How many nodes are required or should change to let the check pass?

## Check Type

You can use the node count check in one of the following modes:

- **actual count >= node count**: Can be used to assure that the amount of nodes is equal or more compared to the given node count target.
- **actual count increases by node count**: Check if the node count is above your given target.
- **actual count decreases by node count**: Check if the node count is below your given target.
