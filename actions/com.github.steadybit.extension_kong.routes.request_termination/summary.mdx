# Introduction

This action configures the [Kong request termination plugin](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/request-termination/) to cause abnormal behavior in the communication between **routes**.

# Use Cases

 - Verify service communication robustness.
 - Understand how services degrade when a specific route becomes unavailable.
 - Attack a subset of the traffic flowing through your system.
 - Inject abnormal response bodies to learn how downstream services handle uncommon scenarios.

# Rollback

Whenever the action or the experiment completes, the configured plugin is deleted through Kong's admin API.

| Consumer         | You may optionally define for which Kong consumer the traffic should be impacted.                                                                                                           |                                                                                                   |

| Body             | The raw response body to be returned for terminated requests. This is mutually exclusive with the message parameter. A body parameter takes precedence over the message parameter.          |                                                                                                   |

| Trigger          | When not set, the plugin always activates. When set to a string, the plugin will activate exclusively on requests containing either a header or a query parameter that is named the string. |                                                                                                   |
