# Introduction

[K6](https://k6.io/) is a developer-centric, free and open-source load testing tool built for making performance testing a productive and enjoyable experience. You can integrate the execution of K6 load tests directly into your experiments.

# Details

To use K6 you need to upload your K6-Test-Script. This can be done simply by adding a step of type "K6" and use the provided File-Upload.

Within the K6 load test you have access to your provided parameters as environment variables. You can use them in the script via e.g. `${__ENV.TARGETURL}` as shown in our basic example below.

If you don't know where to start, feel free to use our example. It is a very basic script and will just perform some HTTP-Calls on a specified endpoint.
