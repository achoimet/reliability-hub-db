# Intent

Your application should continue to function properly and indicate unavailability appropriately in case of increased connection latency to PostgreSQL.
Additionally, this experiment can highlight requests that need optimization of timeouts to prevent dropped requests.

# Motivation

Latencies in shared or overloaded databases are a common occurrence and can significantly impact the performance of your application.
By conducting this experiment, you can gain insights into the robustness of your application and identify areas for improvement.

# Structure

To conduct this experiment, we will ensure that all pods are ready, and the load-balanced user-facing endpoint is fully functional.
We will then simulate a latency attack on the PostgreSQL database by adding a delay of XXX milliseconds to all traffic to the database port.
During the attack, we will monitor the system's behavior to ensure that the service remains operational and can deliver its purpose.
We will also analyze the performance metrics to identify any request types that are most affected by the latency and optimize them accordingly.
Finally, we will end the attack and monitor the system's recovery time to ensure that it returns to its normal state promptly.
By conducting this experiment, we can gain valuable insights into our application's resilience to database latencies and make informed decisions to optimize its performance under stress.
