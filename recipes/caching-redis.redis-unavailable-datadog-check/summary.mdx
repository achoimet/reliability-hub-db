# Intent

This experiment is designed to test the resilience of your application to Redis downtime by simulating an unavailable Redis instance.
The aim is to ensure that your system can handle the outage gracefully and continue to deliver its intended functionality.
The experiment can help you identify potential weaknesses in your system and take appropriate measures to improve its performance and resilience.

# Motivation

Redis downtime can lead to degraded system performance, lost data, and potentially long system recovery times.
By testing the resilience of your system to Redis downtime, you can ensure that your system can handle the outage gracefully and continue to deliver its intended functionality.
Additionally, you can identify any potential weaknesses in your system and take appropriate measures to improve its performance and resilience.

# Structure

We will verify that a load-balanced user-facing endpoint fully works while having all pods ready.
As soon as we simulate Redis downtime, we expect the system to indicate unavailability appropriately and maintain its throughput.
To simulate downtime, we can shut down the Redis instance. The experiment aims to ensure that your system can handle the outage gracefully and continue to deliver its intended functionality.
The performance should return to normal after the Redis instance is available again.
