# Introduction

An agent is a software that runs in a container in your environment or your host machine.

Our agents continuously discover and deliver target data to the platform and help you create targeted experiments based on always up-to-date data.
Therefore, it is necessary that you deploy the agents to the locations in which you want to perform analyses and experiments.

It provides the needed inside of your system.

The agent is also responsible for our standard checks, metrics, and attacks.


`Without agents, there is no discovery data, and thus no experiments are possible.`


We offer our agents for different platforms and have made the installation as easy as possible for you.

## Extensions

In addition to the standard agents, we also offer extensions.
But you still need the standard agent to use the extensions.
