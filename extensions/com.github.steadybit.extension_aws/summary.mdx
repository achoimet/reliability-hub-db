# Introduction

The AWS (Amazon Web Services) extension bundles various attack, target discovery, and check capabilities for the AWS product pallet. You can use the AWS extension to change the state of EC2 instances and reboot RDS instances.

The AWS extension is essentially an adapter for the AWS APIs. It currently only supports a small set of AWS APIs. If you need additional capabilities, please consider contributing these directly via GitHub.
