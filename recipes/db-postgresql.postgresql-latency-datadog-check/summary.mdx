# Intent

This experiment aims to validate the resilience of your application to database latencies.
By inducing a delay attack on the PostgreSQL port, we want to observe how your application behaves under stress and ensure it can maintain its expected level of service during this time.
The experiment also serves to identify any bottlenecks or inefficiencies in your application's request processing pipeline that could be optimized to better handle database latencies.
Additionally, we want to ensure that your application's timeout configurations are correctly set to prevent dropping requests during the attack.


# Motivation

Latencies in shared or overloaded databases are a common occurrence and can significantly impact the performance of your application.
By conducting this experiment, you can gain insights into the robustness of your application and identify areas for improvement.

# Structure

To conduct this experiment, we will ensure that all pods are ready, and the load-balanced user-facing endpoint is fully functional.
We will then simulate a latency attack on the PostgreSQL database by adding a delay of XXX milliseconds to all traffic to the database port.
During the attack, we will monitor the system's behavior to ensure that the service remains operational and can deliver its purpose.
We will also analyze the performance metrics to identify any request types that are most affected by the latency and optimize them accordingly.
Finally, we will end the attack and monitor the system's recovery time to ensure that it returns to its normal state promptly.
By conducting this experiment, we can gain valuable insights into our application's resilience to database latencies and make informed decisions to optimize its performance under stress.
