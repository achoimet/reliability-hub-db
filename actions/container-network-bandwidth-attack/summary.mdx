# Introduction

Limits bandwidth for all matching network traffic.

# Details

_Note:_ If you are going to attack containers using network attacks, **all containers in the target's namespace** (e.g. all containers belonging to the same Kubernetes Pod or Replica Set) will be affected. In case you want to target the traffic of a single container in the namespace you can for example use the port parameter to limit the blast radius.


# Use Cases

    * Understand your service's performance under load
    * Test your service's resilience to network attacks
    * Test your service's resilience to decreased bandwidth

# Parameters

| Parameter         | Description                                          | Default  |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Network Bandwidth | How much traffic should be allowed per second?       | 1024kbit |
| Duration          | How long should the bandwidth be reduced?            | 30s      |
| Hostname          | Restrict to which hosts the traffic is reduced       |          |
| IP Address        | Restrict to which IP address the traffic is reduced  |          |
| Network Interface | Target Network Interface which should be attacked    | eth0     |
| Port Number       | Restrict to which port number the traffic is reduced |          |
