# Introduction

Inject corrupt packets by introducing single bit error at a random offset into network traffic.

# Details

_Note:_ If you are going to attack containers using network attacks, **all containers in the target's namespace** (e.g. all containers belonging to the same Kubernetes Pod or Replica Set) will be affected. In case you want to target the traffic of a single container in the namespace you can for example use the port parameter to limit the blast radius.

# Use Cases

    * Testing network resilience to bit errors

# Parameters

| Parameter          | Description                                            | Default |

| Package Corruption | How much traffic should be corrupted?                  | 15%     |
| Duration           | How much of the traffic should be corrupted??          | 30s     |
| Hostname           | Restrict to which hosts the traffic is corrupted?      |         |
| IP Address         | Restrict to which IP address the traffic is corrupted  |         |
| Port Number        | Restrict to which port number the traffic is corrupted |         |
