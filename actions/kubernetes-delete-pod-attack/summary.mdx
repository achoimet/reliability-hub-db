# Introduction

Deletes one pod after the other for a given Kubernetes deployment over a configurable period of time. The delay between pod deletions is `{attack duration} / {number of pods in deployment}`.

Stopping this attack will cause no further pods to be deleted. Kubernetes is responsible for pod restoration/restarts.


# Use Cases

    * To test the resiliency of a deployment to pod failures
    * Check the behavior of the application when a pod is deleted and the pod is restored by Kubernetes
    * Check if your load balancer can handle pod failures

# Parameters

| Parameter | Description           | Default |
| --------- | --------------------- | ------- |
| Duration  | Total attack duration | 60s     |
