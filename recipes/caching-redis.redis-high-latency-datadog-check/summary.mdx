# Intent

This experiment is designed to test the resilience of your application to Redis latency by simulating delays in Redis operations.
The aim is to ensure that your system can handle increased processing time and maintain its throughput during increased latency.
The experiment can help you identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies in your system and take appropriate measures to improve its performance and reliability.

# Motivation

Latency issues in Redis can lead to degraded system performance, longer response times, and potentially lost or delayed data.
By testing the resilience of your system to Redis latency, you can ensure that your system can handle increased processing time and maintain its throughput during increased latency.
Additionally, you can identify any potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies in your system and take appropriate measures to optimize its performance and reliability.

# Structure

We will verify that a load-balanced user-facing endpoint fully works while having all pods ready.
As soon as we simulate Redis latency, we expect the system to maintain its throughput and indicate unavailability appropriately.
To simulate latency, we can introduce delays in Redis operations. The experiment aims to ensure that your system can handle increased processing time and maintain its throughput during increased latency.
The performance should return to normal after the latency has ended.
