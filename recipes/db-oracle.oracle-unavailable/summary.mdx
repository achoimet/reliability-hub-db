# Intent

An unavailable Oracle database might be too severe for suitable fallbacks and requires your system to indicate unavailability appropriately

# Motivation

Depending on your context, an unavailable Oracle database may be considered so severe that there are no suitable fallbacks.
In this case, ensuring that your system is indicating an appropriate error message is essential.
After the Oracle database is back again, your system should recover automatically.

# Structure

We ensure that a load-balanced user-facing endpoint fully works while having all pods ready.
As soon as we simulate an unavailable Oracle database, we expect the user-facing endpoint to indicate unavailability by responding with a "Service unavailable" status.
To simulate the unavailability, we can blackhole the Oracle database client connection using the hostname `db.internal.steadybit.com` so that no incoming or outgoing traffic is going through.
The endpoint should recover automatically once the Oracle database is reachable again.
