# Introduction

With the Prometheus metric check, you can gather Prometheus metrics (using PromQL). Once gathered, you can optionally add a metric check on top. This capability is tremendously helpful in interacting with existing metric pipelines and Prometheus alerts.

# Use Cases

 - Leverage Prometheus alerts to validate a hypothesis.
 - Validate that Prometheus alerting rules are functional, i.e., that they trigger during incidents.
 - Try new alerting rules, e.g., from [Awesome Prometheus Alerts](https://awesome-prometheus-alerts.grep.to/).
 - Collect Prometheus metrics for later visualization.
 - Compare Prometheus metrics against each other.

# Rollback

No rollback necessary.
