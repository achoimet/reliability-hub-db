# Intent

Verify that an increased latency in your RabbitMQ message delivery is handled by your application properly by having increased processing time but still being able to maintain the throughput.

# Motivation

Latency issues in RabbitMQ can lead to degraded system performance, longer response times, and potentially lost or delayed data. By testing the resilience of your system to RabbitMQ latency, you can ensure that your system can handle increased processing time and maintain its throughput during increased latency. Additionally, you can identify any potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies in your system and take appropriate measures to optimize its performance and reliability.

# Structure

We will verify that a load-balanced user-facing endpoint fully works while having all pods ready. As soon as we simulate RabbitMQ latency, we expect the system to maintain its throughput and indicate unavailability appropriately. To simulate latency, we can introduce delays in message delivery. The experiment aims to ensure that your system can handle increased processing time and maintain its throughput during increased latency. The performance should return to normal after the latency has ended.
