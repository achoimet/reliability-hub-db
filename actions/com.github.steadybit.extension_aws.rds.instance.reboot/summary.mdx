# Introduction

This action leverages AWS EC2 API to manipulate the state of RDS database instances. More specifically, it can reboot them.

# Use Cases

- Understand how a service behaves when the database is not available, e.g., check whether it reconnects.
- Understand the performance impact when rebooting the database, e.g., cold caches.

# Rollback

Note that this attack does not support any rollback. The attack only transmits the API call, i.e., RebootDBInstance.

# Parameters

*No parameters.*
