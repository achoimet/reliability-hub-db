# Introduction

Check if the count of ready nodes is matching your expectation

It counts the number of all nodes and performs the check defined by the given check type.

# Use Cases

 - Check if the ready node count matches a given amount
 - Check if the ready node count increases by a given amount
 - Check if the ready node count decreases by a given amount

# Parameters

| Parameter  | Description                                                         | Default |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Timeout    | How long should the check wait for the specified node count?        | 10s     |
| Check Type | How should the node count change? (See values below)                |         |
| Node Count | How many nodes are required or should change to let the check pass? |         |

## Check Type

You can use the node count check in one of the following modes:

- **actual count >= node count**: Can be used to assure that the amount of nodes is equal or more compared to the given node count target.
- **actual count increases by node count**: Check if the node count is above your given target.
- **actual count decreases by node count**: Check if the node count is below your given target.
