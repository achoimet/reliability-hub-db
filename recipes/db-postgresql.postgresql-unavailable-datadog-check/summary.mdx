# Intent

An unavailable PostgreSQL database might be too severe for suitable fallbacks and requires your system to indicate unavailability appropriately
In this case, we want to assess that at least one monitor in datadog is alerting us

# Motivation

Depending on your context, an unavailable PostgreSQL database may be considered so severe that there are no suitable fallbacks.
In this case, ensuring that your system is indicating an appropriate error message is essential.
After the PostgreSQL database is back again, your system should recover automatically.

# Structure

We ensure that a load-balanced user-facing endpoint fully works while having all pods ready.
As soon as we simulate an unavailable PostgreSQL database, we expect the user-facing endpoint to indicate unavailability by responding with a "Service unavailable" status.
To simulate the unavailability, we can blackhole the PostgreSQL database client connection using the port `5432` so that no incoming or outgoing traffic is going through.
The endpoint should recover automatically once the PostgreSQL database is reachable again.
