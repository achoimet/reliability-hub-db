# Introduction

The AWS cloud service agent is software that runs in a container in your environment or on your host machine.

It continuously discovers and delivers cloud target data to the platform and helps you create targeted experiments based on always up-to-date data.

The cloud service agent uses cloud APIs to interact with cloud resources.
