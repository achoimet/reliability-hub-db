# Introduction

This action leverages AWS EC2 API to manipulate the state of RDS database instances. It stops the database instance for a given duration and then starts it again.

As it is not possible to stop instances of Multi-AZ clusters, please use the [Trigger DB Cluster Failover](/action/com.github.steadybit.extension_aws.rds.cluster.failover) action instead.

# Use Cases

- Understand how a service behaves when the database is not available, e.g., check whether it reconnects.
- Understand the performance impact when rebooting the database, e.g., cold caches.

# Rollback

The DB instance is started again on rollback.

# Parameters

*No parameters.*
