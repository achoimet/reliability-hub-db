# Intent

This experiment is to see how behave your application when the database is having some latencies, your application should be able to keep up.
It can also highlight some of your requests that needs optimization to less suffer in case of latencies.
You can also detect if the timeouts of your application are correctly configured and will not drop the requests because of the latency induced.


# Motivation

Sometimes when the database is shared and/or a huge request is made, the database can suffer from latencies, this experiment can demonstrate which requests will suffer the most from this.

# Structure

We ensure that a load-balanced user-facing endpoint fully works while having all pods ready.
As soon as we simulate a latency PostgreSQL database, we expect some monitors to trigger based on latency but the service must continue to deliver his purpose.
To simulate the latency, we can create a delay attack with the PostgreSQL port so every traffic towards this port is having a delay of XXX milliseconds.
The performance should go back to normal after the attack ended.
