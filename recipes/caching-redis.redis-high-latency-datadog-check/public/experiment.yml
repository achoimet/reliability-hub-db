name: "Add latency to the Redis cache and check datadog monitors behaviour"
version: '1'
type: 'experiment'
description: "This experiment tests the resilience of your application to Redis latency by simulating delays in Redis operations.
   The experiment aims to ensure that your system can handle increased processing time and maintain its throughput during increased latency.
   By conducting this experiment, you can identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies in your system and take appropriate measures to improve its performance and reliability."

experiment:
  name: "Verify graceful degradation while Redis suffers a high latency"
  team: "{{teamKey}}"
  hypothesis: "Under simulated Redis latency conditions, the system can maintain its performance and indicate unavailability appropriately.
The experiment will identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the system, allowing for optimization and improvement.
The system's performance will return to normal after the latency has ended."
