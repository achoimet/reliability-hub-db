# Introduction

This action leverages AWS EC2 API to trigger a RDS Cluster failover. This is done by promoting a replica to the primary instance.

# Use Cases

- Understand how a service behaves when the database is performing a failover
- Understand the performance impact when the database performs a failover, e.g., cold caches.

# Rollback

Note that this attack does not support any rollback. The attack triggers the reboot via API. The failover can't be canceled.

# Parameters

*No parameters.*
