# Introduction

The Datadog extension bridges the world of Steadybit and Datadog.
Specifically, it allows the usage of Datadog monitors within Steadybit and events are reported back to Datadog whenever a chaos engineering experiment is active.

## Integration of DataDog in Steadybit
With the [Monitor Status Check](/action/com.github.steadybit.extension_datadog.monitor.status_check) you can integrate your DataDog monitors into your experiments.
Check that your observability strategy is working as expected by verifying that DataDog monitors notice a fault injected by Steadybit.

With the [Create Downtime Action](/action/com.github.steadybit.extension_datadog.monitor.downtime) you can do exactly the opposite. You can mute your monitors during an experiment to avoid false alarms.

## Integration of Steadybit in DataDog
The extension automatically reports experiment executions to DataDog which helps you to correlate detected anomalies in DataDog.
Furthermore, you can get a dashboard to see amount of experiment executions by installing Steadybit's [DataDog integration](https://app.datadoghq.eu/integrations/steadybit).
