# Introduction

This action leverages AWS EC2 API to manipulate the state of RDS database instances. It triggers stopping a database instance.

As it is not possible to stop instances of Multi-AZ clusters, please use the [Trigger DB Cluster Failover](/action/com.github.steadybit.extension_aws.rds.cluster.failover) action instead.

**Note:** This action will not perform a rollback. You will need to restart the database instance.

Stopping a DB instance will take several minutes or even hours in case of issues.

# Use Cases

- Understand how a service behaves when the database is not available, e.g., check whether it reconnects.
- Understand the performance impact when stopping the database, e.g., cold caches.

# Rollback

Note that this attack does not support any rollback. The attack triggers the reboot via API. The stop can't be canceled.

# Parameters

*No parameters.*
